1) On end of game do not clear the screen allow last stuff
to be seen.

2) Add PID to tempfile, check for a running proc with the same
PID, otherwise overwrite the tempfile.

3) change LOCK macro into a function that loops for a bit then
asks if it should continue, then again ....

4) Break out pathnames into pathnames.h

5) Make it compile under Linux as well

6) Put it out again.

7) More neatening up - Posix style functions etc DONE
 
8) replace error messages with perror();

9) do not clear screen before printing score so that people can see
   what went wrong. I probably put some curses commands in the wrong
   place.  DONE

10)Add comments especially at the beginning of functions. DONE

11) Use curses functions to place the string "press any key to continue"
    on the screen after death.

12) Make the scores file handling more consistant with other BSD games.

13) When a wrong passwd is entered, sleep(1) so that the message can
be seen.

14) put scorefile in /var/games  DONE makefile and wand_head.h DONE

15) ....Maybe think about locking, but snake
does not do that ...
